Command Line Arguments
----------------------

Example(via iPython):  run ME_Euler.py -m 100x100.txt -v v100.txt -s 6
 
-m | -v | -s
  (required) Specifies the T (kinetic) and V (potential) matrix of the initial Hamiltonian to evolve as well as the number of steps to take for the Euler Method. 

    -m - Square diagonalized matrix containing eigenvalues as elements of diagonal. Matrix in text file must of be of the form:
	
	a1 a2 a3
	a4 a5 a6
        a6 a7 a8
	
as in a white space between each elements and a new line after each row of elements starting at the first character of the text file.

    -v - Square symmetric matrix containing inital potential values as elements. Matrix in text file must be of exact same form as described above. 

    -s - number of steps for Euler Method to take, only integer values accepted. 

Note: argument of -m and -v must be of the same size.

Included Packages And Files
---------------------------

Included file is utils.py which contains gmpy library. 

INSTALLATION OF GMPY(LINUX):
    sudo aptitude install libgmp-dev
    sudo pip install gmpy

Algorithmic Analysis
--------------------

Running files for matrices of size (number of diagonal elements) 2, 3, ... , 9, 10, 20, ... , 90, 100, 200 and plotting. We conclude that the algorithm runs at n^2, where n is the matrix size.
